# Scripts
A public collection of scripts and other things I've made for various reasons. Many of these were hacked together to do a single job, and are quite old and of rather poor quality. I'd like to think most of them do not reflect my bash-ability (haha), or really, much of anything else for that matter

Feel free to use or modify them however you want, credit would be nice

proton-ge-update.sh is a Proton-GE version-management script for Steam and Lutris. As far as I can tell, no one else has ever used it, despite my best attempts. I find it works pretty well.

RootlessDD.sh is a script to replace someone else's script, which converted rootful tweaks to a Xina-compatible rootless state. To be clear, while these could be used on Xina, this was intended for use on Dopamine, which doesn't come with a patcher or compatibility layer.

I've long thought about making a dd-based binary patcher, and now that I have, I'm relatively satisfied. There are probably better ways to go around doing it than relying on GNU's `strings`, but this works.

The two ahk scripts macOS-ify certain Windows keyboard actions. Red Dragon is a macOS terminal theme. The two jsons bring control-key based deleting and word jumping features to macOS via Karabiner. The two plists are aircast and airupnp LaunchAgents.
